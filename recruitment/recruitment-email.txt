Dear ,

Nice to e-meet you, my name is Daphne Muller, support lead at Nextcloud. I hope you are doing well! I got your contact details as I help with analysing the results of the "Nextcloud Community Survey". 


Thank you so much for participating in our survey! We read every reply to the survey and we're now reaching out to people to interview them, to get a deeper insight. You are selected! We would absolutely love to be able to interview you for our work!


For this interview and research, Nextcloud has teamed up with CISPA Helmholtz Center to further investigate how Nextcloud is used and which factors are causing difficulties when hosting instances. Our goal is to inform the future development of Nextcloud and improve information resources and tools for the community.


The interview session will last about ~1h and you will be compensated with 30â‚¬ for your valuable time. The information you share with us during the session will be confidential. We follow scientific standards, which means you can withdraw from the session at any time and you will remain anonymous in any reports.


Would you be up for participating in an interview with us? The interview will take place online through Nextcloud Talk, and you would be interviewing with Lea. Lea is researcher at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. 


If you are interested in participating, please let me know by replying to this e-mail! 


Warm regards,


Daphne


(for the Nextcloud team)
